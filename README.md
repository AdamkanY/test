### Scenario

EduPeerFHNW is conceived as a comprehensive support system for FHNW students, promoting academic excellence and social integration through peer-to-peer engagement and support for exchange students.

### User Stories

Student User Stories:

- As a student, I want to offer or find tutoring in various subjects, specifying if the session is recurring or one-time, create a title and description for the offer, and set the timeline.
- As a student, I want to offer mentoring for projects in different subjects, indicating if the mentoring is recurring or not, naming the offer, providing a description, and selecting timelines.
- As a student, I want to initiate independent projects, distinct from the curriculum, deciding if they're recurring or one-time, naming the project, detailing it, and scheduling timelines.
- As a student, I want to volunteer as a buddy for international students, aiding their adaptation to the academic and cultural environment at FHNW.
- As a student, I wish to assign rooms to the created mentoring or collaboration events.

Admin User Stories:

- As an admin, I need to modify or delete any tutoring offers or requests, project mentoring, collaborations, and buddy offers to ensure the platform's content remains relevant and appropriate.
- As an admin, I want access to logs that monitor the creation of tutoring sessions, project collaborations, etc., including their titles and timelines, to maintain oversight.
- As an admin, I need to post advertisements seeking buddies, tutors, mentors, or project collaborators to fill gaps in the community's needs.
- As an admin, I should be able to assign international students to local buddies, ensuring a personalized and supportive integration experience.
- As an admin, I must manage user accounts, including the ability to create, modify, or delete them, to ensure the platform's users are genuine and active.

Super Admin Stories:

- As a super admin, I need to manage admin accounts, granting me the authority to create, alter, and delete admin profiles to maintain a high standard of platform oversight.

Common User Story:

- As both an admin and a student (user), I require a web application that is accessible on various mobile devices and desktop computers, ensuring wide accessibility and usability.
- As a user, regardless of being a student or an admin, I need to log in with different roles available on the platform, enabling personalized and role-appropriate access to features and functionalities.
