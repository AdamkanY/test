## Analysis
> ðŸš§: Tailor the analysis to reflect the requirements and objectives of the EduPeerFHNW project.

### Scenario

EduPeerFHNW is conceived as a comprehensive support system for FHNW students, promoting academic excellence and social integration through peer-to-peer engagement and support for exchange students.

### User Stories
1. As a student, I want to offer or find tutoring within the FHNW community to improve or share knowledge in specific subjects.
2. As a student, I wish to collaborate on projects with peers to enhance learning experiences and outcomes.
3. As an exchange student, I'm looking for a local buddy at FHNW to help navigate my new academic and cultural environment.
4. As a local student, I am eager to volunteer as a buddy to provide support and learn about different cultures.

### Use Case

- UC-1 [Peer Tutoring]: Facilitates students in offering or seeking tutoring services.
- UC-2 [Project Collaboration]: Enables students to initiate or join collaborative projects.
- UC-3 [Buddy System]: Connects incoming exchange students with local buddies for support.

## Design
> ðŸš§: Design with consideration for FHNW's Corporate Identity, focusing on user experience and accessibility.

### Wireframe
> ðŸš§: Start with wireframes to layout the web app's structure using tools like draw.io.

### Prototype
> ðŸš§: Develop an interactive prototype using Budibase to test and refine the user interface and experience.

### Domain Design
> ðŸš§: Describe the system's domain model, using Entity-Relationship Diagrams or UML class diagrams to illustrate entity relationships.

## Business Logic 
> ðŸš§: Explain the business logic, especially the algorithm for matching students in the buddy system, including expected paths and methods.

## Implementation
> ðŸš§: Detail the implementation strategy, covering both backend and frontend technologies, and any significant libraries or frameworks utilized.

### Backend Technology
> ðŸš§: This project is built on Spring Boot, using H2 Database for development purposes. Document any additional libraries or frameworks integrated into the project.

### Frontend Technology
> ðŸš§: The frontend is developed with Budibase, focusing on responsive design and user-friendly interfaces. Outline how the frontend interacts with the backend services.

## Execution
> ðŸš§: Provide comprehensive instructions for setting up, running, and deploying the project, including necessary configurations.

## Project Management
> ðŸš§: Summarize the project management approach, detailing roles, contributions, and milestones. Include descriptions of how collaborative efforts were organized and managed.

### Roles
