### Scenario

CommunityFHNW is designed to be a dynamic support and learning platform for students at Fachhochschule Nordwestschweiz (FHNW), fostering a strong sense of academic and social community. It's built on the idea that every student not only seeks knowledge but also has unique insights to share, creating a vibrant cycle of learning and teaching.

The platform allows students to easily find or offer tutoring across a variety of subjects, manage project collaborations, and even volunteer as buddies for international peers, helping them adjust to life at FHNW and in Switzerland. Through CommunityFHNW, students can set up one-time or recurring tutoring sessions, kick-start independent projects beyond the regular curriculum, and create real-world meetings for collaborative work, all within a framework that encourages innovation and mutual support.

For international students, the buddy system is a cornerstone of the platform, providing a welcoming introduction to the academic community and Swiss culture, thanks to the local students eager to share their knowledge and experiences.

Behind the scenes, admins ensure the platform runs smoothly, moderating content and managing accounts to keep the community safe and engaged. They have tools at their disposal to monitor activity, post needed advertisements for tutors or project collaborators, and pair international students with their local buddies. Super admins oversee this all, maintaining the high standards and vision of the platform.

Available on various devices, CommunityFHNW ensures that whether you're on campus or on the move, you can stay connected, making learning flexible and accessible for everyone involved.
